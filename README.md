# <h2 align="center"><samp>  üöÄ Development  </samp></h2>

Developed with JavaScript, leveraging Express, Mongosh, and Mongoose for seamless integration with a MongoDB database. Security is reinforced through the implementation of Bcrypt and JSON Web Token to safeguard user data. Additionally, Nodemailer is used for email confirmation and password recovery, while Multer is utilized to facilitate the transmission of photos within the request body.

# <h2><samp> üéØ Endpoints  </samp></h2>

The system encompasses CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Our social network features various types of endpoints, some of which are highly specific and secure. To enhance security, we've integrated the "isAuthor" besides the "isAdmin" and "isSuperAdmin" middleware. Rigorous testing of all endpoints using Postman was conducted before deploying to the Main branch, ensuring a robust and reliable system.
